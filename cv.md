3. My goal is to become a programmer because it has a great opportunity to build a career.
   I think I have a penchant for this. I want to surround myself with smart and educated people.
   I also want to work with a team of   professionals.
   I learned front-end in 2016, I took courses, but after that, I didn't know what to do. I decided to go back to this in 2018. 
   I am currently studying software engineer at BSUIR. I've been learning programming on my own for two years now. 
   I hope that the RS-school Will help me find a way to further development
   I will never give up!

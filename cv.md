3. My goal is to become a programmer because it has a great opportunity to build a career.
   I think I have a penchant for this. I want to surround myself with smart and educated people.
   I also want to work with a team of   professionals.
   I learned front-end in 2016, I took courses, but after that, I didn't know what to do. I decided to go back to this in 2018. 
   I am currently studying software engineer at BSUIR. I've been learning programming on my own for two years now. 
   I hope that the RS-school Will help me find a way to further development
   I will never give up!

6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
8. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
